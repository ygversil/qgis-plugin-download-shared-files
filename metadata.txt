about=This plugin provides a processing algorithm to download shared files from one or multiple web repositories. For example, if a company IT wants to share common GIS files (aerial photos, digital elevation model, cities polygons, ...) with his colleagues so that they can work offline, she can upload those files onto an internal web server. Then, provided that the plugin has been configured to read this web server, each coworker will be able to download the files by just running the algorithm. The plugin also notifies the user at QGIS startup when new files have been added or files have been updated. And finally, when all files have been downloaded, an HTML report is generated that shows what have been done.
